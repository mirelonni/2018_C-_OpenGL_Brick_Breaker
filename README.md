# Brick Breaker in C++ with OpenGL and a Computer Graphics provided Framework

This is a Visual Studio project made for a homework at Computer Graphics in my third year at University. It was developed in Visual Studio 2017.

The platform is moved with the mouse and the ball is launched by pressing left mouse button.

The powerups have a 10% chance of dropping on each brick and act as follows:

- Blue Powerup: adds a margin on the bottom of the play area, so the ball can't escape. This powerup is timed, and the time remaining represents the height of the blue bar.
- Pink Powerup: gives you another life, up to the maximum of 5 lives.
- Yellow Powerup: makes the ball cut through the bricks (removes the collision with the bricks, not with the walls).
